The worlds greatest oddity has long been the SludgeWorks; a reality-warping cave network that stabs deep into the 
heart of the earth. 
Here, some alien force has caused evolution and natural selection to go into overdrive, mutating life within beyond 
all plausibility. 
This rift contains great treasures, but only only whispers of its powers reach the surface. 
Mutated and feral, vaguely-human remnants of previous expeditions wander it's twisted caverns, 
shying away from the light and adapting to their wretched forms. 
Despite these perils, the prospect of eternal life and evolutionary transcendence are rumoured to await those 
brave enough to reach the Mezzanine, the fabled final chamber, and bathe in its ichor.

Can you survive the onslaught of the Cleansing Hand's pious bastion? 
Will the vampyric remnants of the Kyvan Company prevent your descent into the Screaming Ruins? 
Is it possible to enter the Cult of Eternity's palace of hedonism without being kidnapped? 

Will you torch all foliage in your path, or become a living vessel for nature's experiments?

Are you dumb enough to impale a Bloodseeker?

Welcome to the SludgeWorks.
