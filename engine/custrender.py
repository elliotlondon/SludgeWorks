"""A custom rendering engine for python-tcod.
This module bypasses tcod.console_flush to manually adjust where the console
will be rendered.  It uses the FFI to call libtcod and SDL2 functions directly.
It can be extend to allow arbitrary rendering on top of the SDL renderer.
It is also designed to be copied into your own project and imported as a
module.

    The `default tileset` will be used for graphics.
    `viewport` is where to draw the console on the screen.  If it is None then
    the console will be stretched over the full screen.  You can use
    `get_viewport` to make a viewport with specific constraints.
    You will need to call `present` yourself to show the rendered console, if
    the viewport does not cover the full screen then you'll need to call
    `clear` beforehand to clear the pixels outside of the viewport.
    This function can be called multiple times, but the current implementation
    is optimized to handle only one console.  Keep this in mind when rendering
    multiple different consoles.
    This function depends on a provisional function of the libtcod API.  You
    may want to pin your exact version of python-tcod to prevent a break.
